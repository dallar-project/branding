# Dallar Branding: Graphics Standards Manual and Icons

The aim of this section is to provide the materials and resources to establish a consistent visual language across all Dallar products and services, released under the MIT License as per GitHub. This should at least provide logo variants, color swatches, font types, various icons, formatting guidelines, and so on. Further expansion should include official templates for merchandising, social media banners, and interactive icons for web and apps.

Our vision isn't to restrict the expression of content creators for the Dallar. We want creators to freely reference and expand upon it. We believe however that establishing this visual language will strengthen the brand identity of the Dallar, to be immediately recognizable by any product or service related to it.

## Font and Formatting

Our brand uses the Montserrat (Light) typeface in the logo. Montserrat is available as a Google webfont. We will be relying on Montserrat (Medium) by default for paragraphs and columns, not (Regular.) For emphasis on text, we use Montserrat (Bold.) Avoid italics.

The Korean Hangul writing uses the Adobe Gothic typeface (it says "dal" in Korean, which means "moon.)

Avoid widowing paragraphs. Keep paragraphs justified left. Alignment feels good.

## Colors and Swatches

The red color is sampled directly from the incredible NASA Graphics Standard Manual (1976), which is non-menacing and nostalgic of space travel. RGB values at 195,20,39. Its color hex code is #c31427

We should limit our color swatch to red, black and white. In monochromatic format, converting red to full black is preferred for maximum visual impact. 

We should stay consistent with white backgrounds when possible, otherwise use red with white logo. If the background needs to be black or dark, make sure to keep the white logo variant.

## Composition

We are reliant on visual hierarchy and weighting to convey information effectively and reliably. Embrace flatness, composition, and negative space.

If space is reduced to a square shape icon, crop only the moon.

## Meaning

The "dal" (Korean moon) is a highly symbolic metaphor for success in the cryptocurrency community. However for the Dallar community, it is an inside joke about someone looking like they're pooping in the toilet from the side.
