Dallar Branding: Graphics Standards Manual and Icons

The aim of this section is to provide the materials and resources to establish a consistent visual language across all Dallar products and services, released under the MIT License as per GitHub. This should at least provide logo variants, color swatches, font types, various icons, formatting guidelines, and so on. Further expansion should include official templates for merchandising, social media banners, and interactive icons for web and apps.

Our vision isn't to restrict the expression of content creators for the Dallar. We want creators to freely reference and expand upon it. We believe however that establishing this visual language will strengthen the brand identity of the Dallar, to be immediately recognizable by any product or service related to it.
